        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This web application is designed to manage inclusive services pricing for treatments and services. It focuses on providing pricing information for radiology instruments that accommodate abnormal body types and comprehensive detoxification services.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Features and Functionalities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> Introduces the system with an updated splash screen image and provides navigation to all sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Pages:</strong> Separate forms in addService.html and addTreatment.html allow users to add new records with labels and required fields.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Pages:</strong> Tables in manageService.html and manageTreatment.html display the first three records from the respective datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Consistent navigation menus on every page ensure easy access to the various sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Styling:</strong> The my_styles.css file is used to provide collapsed inside borders and alternating row colors for tables, without using the colgroup element.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
        <p>
            The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A clear header and updated splash screen immediately convey the applicationâ€™s theme.</li>
            <li>Navigation links allow users to easily switch between viewing and adding records.</li>
            <li>Forms are designed with clear labels and required inputs to minimize errors during data entry.</li>
            <li>Data tables are styled for clarity and ease of reading.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Database Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            Although this submission focuses on the front-end, the application is intended to integrate with a database that holds two tables: one for Services and one for Treatments. Each table will have at least five fields and multiple records.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This design document outlines the structure and functionality of the Inclusive Services Pricing & Treatment Management system. Future enhancements may include search functionality, record editing, and deletion features.
