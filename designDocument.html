        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This application manages inclusive services pricing, focusing on radiology
            instruments that accommodate abnormal body types and detoxification services.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Features and Functionalities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> Uses an updated splash screen image and introduces the app’s theme.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Pages:</strong> addService.html and addTreatment.html provide forms with required fields for each column in the “Services” and “Treatments” tables.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Pages:</strong> manageService.html and manageTreatment.html show the first three records from each table with no colgroup elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Each page has consistent navigation, so users can quickly switch between viewing and adding records.</li>
            <li><strong>Styling:</strong> my_styles.css ensures collapsed inside borders and table stylings, with alternating row backgrounds for clarity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
        <p>
            The UI is simple, with a clear header, a navigation menu, and main content
            sections. Each form has labels and required attributes to ensure complete data input.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Database Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            Although this submission focuses on the front-end, the underlying database
            would contain two tables: “Services” and “Treatments,” each with at least
            five fields and five records.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This document details the structure and design of the Inclusive Services
            Pricing & Treatment Management system. Future enhancements might include
            search capabilities, record editing, and record deletion.
